## Description

This is a social network API, so functionally this is the backend of a social media website. While currently not linked to a frontend website, this program can handle all functionality within a typical social media site. This program allows you to make an account, post your thoughts, add friends, and react to their thoughts. I wanted to utilize a NoSQL database for this app to allow for large scale user data storage without compromising the functionality of interacting with said user data.
